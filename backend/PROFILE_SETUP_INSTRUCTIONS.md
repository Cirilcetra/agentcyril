# Fixing Profile Data Issues in Supabase

## Problem Background

There was an issue with how profile data was being stored in Supabase. While users were being created correctly in the auth system and users table, the profiles table was not being properly populated with user-specific profiles. This led to the following problems:

1. Multiple users sharing the same profile data
2. Changes to one user's profile affecting other users
3. Failure to retrieve user-specific profile data 

## How To Fix

### 1. Apply the Updated Schema

To fix these issues, you need to apply the updated database schema that includes proper user-profile associations and triggers to automatically create profiles.

1. Open your Supabase dashboard
2. Click on "SQL Editor"
3. Create a new query
4. Copy the entire contents of the file `backend/APPLY_SCHEMA_IN_SUPABASE.sql` 
5. Paste the contents into the SQL Editor
6. Run the query

This SQL script will:
- Create all necessary tables with proper foreign key relationships
- Add a `projects` field to store project data as JSON
- Create triggers to automatically create profiles for new users
- Set up proper RLS (Row Level Security) policies

### 2. Restart the Backend Server

After applying the schema, restart the backend server to ensure it uses the updated code:

```bash
cd backend
python -m app.main
```

### 3. Test With Multiple Accounts

To verify the fix has worked:

1. Sign up with a new email account
2. Update your profile
3. Sign out
4. Sign up with a different email account 
5. Verify that you see a default profile, not the one you created with the first account
6. Make changes to this profile and confirm they don't affect the first profile

## Technical Details of the Fix

The following changes were made to fix the issue:

1. **Fixed Profile Data Storage**:
   - Added a `projects` field to store project list data as JSON
   - Ensures each user has their own profile record

2. **Improved User Handling**:
   - Updated the `update_profile_data` function to use `upsert` for users
   - Enhanced the handling of user creation in the database
   - Fixed the user-profile association

3. **Better Error Handling**:
   - Added detailed logging
   - Improved error catching around JSON conversions
   - Enhanced fallback mechanisms

4. **Better Schema Verification**:
   - Added code to check if the schema has been applied correctly
   - Provides warnings if database isn't set up correctly
